      <h1>About the Blog</h1>
      <p>I created this blog to share my insights about programming, web
      development, and programs I use, but this blog is not limited to just
      those topics.</p>
      <p>
      The particular programming languages of interest to me are C, C++,
      JavaScript, SQL, Emacs Lisp, Scheme, Python, and the shell.
      </p>
      <!-- explain what they are and why I would want to write about them -->
      <dl>
	<dt>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>
</dt>
	<dd>
	  C is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative
	  programming</a> language that compiles to binary code. It is praised
	  for its speed and simplicity, and is the lingua franca of
	  programming. C++ is one of a number of "successors" to C and is the
	  most common among them.  Modern C++ is basically C, plus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object
	  oriented programming</a> abilities, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional
	  programming</a> abilities, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_(C%2B%2B)">type
	  abstraction</a>. Most operating systems and high performance programs
	  are written in C or C++. C and C++ are more relevant than ever.  Every
	  platform natively supports C or C++: smartphones (Android and iPhone),
	  any desktop operating system, embedded devices, web browsers (via
	  <a href="http://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>).
	</dd>
	<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  JavaScript (or ECMAScript) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting
	  language</a>, originally created to extend web browser
	  functionality. JavaScript is about as ubiquitous as C and C++.  Most
	  every computer has a JavaScript capable browser or can run it outside
	  the browser, such as with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>
	  or <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html">Nashorn</a>. I
	  am also interested in exploring languages that transpile to
	  JavaScript, especially <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a> and <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>.

</dt>
	<dd>
	  SQL is the standard relational database query language, and most
	  databases are relational. The field of databases has become more
	  heterogeneous with non-SQL databases filling niches where relational
	  databases are inappropriate or not optimal.  This blog is an example
	  of one, in this case, an XML document database.
	</dd>
	<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp">Emacs Lisp</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> is my
	  editor of choice and its functionality is extended by using its own
	  programming language, Emacs Lisp. Emacs Lisp was my first real
	  exposure to programming.  It is not just useful for extending Emacs,
	  but also good for learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">s-expression</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)#Syntactic_macros">macro</a>
	  programming and quickly experimenting with most any language idea that
	  is used in general purpose programming languages. Emacs is constantly
	  being improved, people are creating add-on packages, and I desire to
	  share and further my knowledge about it.
	</dd>
	<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  Scheme is a Lisp-like language praised for its simplicity and
	  expressiveness, and if it was more widely adopted, would be my
	  preferred scripting language.  However, scheme programming techniques
	  are often applicable in other lisps such as Emacs Lisp, Clojure, and
	  ClojureScript. My preferred scheme implementations are <a href="http://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a>. I am also
	  interested in <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, which is a
	  language ecosystem whose primary language is a Scheme derivative.
	</dd>
	<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  Python is possibly the most common scripting language in the Unix
	  ecosystem and it has an extensive library. Many programs are extensible
	  with Python.  The language is of interest to me for pragmatic reasons.
	  Python is a fair scripting language, but I think that the language
	  itself is similar but inferior to Scheme. It lacks a macro language. I
	  think the language's forced indents were a mistake, and it cannot do
	  thread level, high performance parallel programming.
	</dd>
	<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">Shell Scripting</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  This blog is created using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix#Components">Unix tool kit</a>,
	  plus additional programs. In Unix, most programs can be used as
	  functions in shell scripts, blurring the line between program and
	  function. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> is my
	  primary shell scripting language. The Unix toolkit is a set of
	  standard tools found on all Unix and Unix compliant systems.

      <h2>Rolling My Own Static Site Generator</h2> <p>My blog was initially
      hosted on Blogger. While it was quick to setup, it was cumbersome to add
      programming blog posts, and the site's look was restricted to templates. I
      use Emacs <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> for taking notes and
      it has the ability to export to many formats, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a>, and can export more
      than one file at a time. I wanted the ability to export my Org notes as
      blog posts without post-export editing. With Blogger, this was
      impossible. I initially tried <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, which is a static site
      generator written in Python. However, I did not like the output HTML
      markup; it used too many <code>div</code>'s and did not take advantage of
      HTML5 tags such as <code>main</code> and <code>aside</code>.  I also
      wanted more control over navigation.  I knew that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> (Extensible Stylesheet
      Language Transformations) would be perfect for this kind of task,
      converting XHTML Org output to HTML in the format that I wanted, with a
      consistent header, asides, and a footer; this is precisely the use case
      that it was designed for.  The main challenge was creating a document
      database from Org's export, and then using that information to generate
      navigation content and pages. I also took this as an opportunity to
      modernize my HTML and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>
      skills.</p>

      <h2>Why Blog</h2>      
      <p>Every programmer should have a blog. At the very least, it serves as a
      platform to show your knowledge in an accessible format.  In addition,
      every programmer is well served by having an account on a code sharing
      site such as GitHub, but I believe that the blog is more important.
      Non-trivial programs are difficult, time-consuming things to create and
      understand, so even if you post quality code on GitHub et. al., you are
      still relying on people taking time to read and understand the code.  In a
      blog, you can show code excepts and explain them, reducing the reader's
      mental load and increasing inter-communication.

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
	I grew up in Eagle River, Alaska, attending school at Birchwood ABC and
	then at Chugiak High School.  I completed my Bachelors of Science in
	Computer Science at UAA in 2015.  I originally pursued an Electrical
	Engineering degree at UAF; but, after taking a programming class, I
	found that I was better at and more passionate for programming.
      </p>
      <p>
	I hold a 5<sup>th</sup> Dan Black Belt in Taekwondo. I also compete nationally and
	I am a USAT referee.  I played house-level hockey as a member of the
	Mustang Hockey Association, playing defenseman.  I also love to ski,
	hunt, and fish, and regularly go running and hiking.
      </p>
